            <h1>1-Rising Sea Levels: Coastal Cities at Risk</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">If climate change continues to be ignored, ice caps will melt, 
                causing sea levels to rise. This will flood coastal cities like Miami and Dhaka, 
                displacing millions of people.</p></div>

            <h1>2-More Frequent and Severe Natural Disasters</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts will become more powerful and frequent.
               Homes and infrastructure will be destroyed,
               leading to massive economic losses and worsening food problems.</p></div>

            <h1>3-Threats to Biodiversity</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Ignoring climate change will put thousands of species at risk of extinction. 
               Ecosystems like coral reefs will be damaged, threatening global food security.</p>

            <h1>4-Impact on Human Health</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Rising temperatures will increase heat-related illnesses and air pollution,
                leading to more health problems and the spread of new diseases.</p>
        </div>
                <img src="4.1.jpeg" alt="Coral reefs, often referred to as the 'rainforests of the sea,' are already dying."  width="1100" height="563">

            <h1>5-Economic Consequences</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">The economic cost will be enormous,
                with industries suffering losses and countries spending trillions on repairing damages and dealing with crises.</p>
        </div>

            <h1>Conclusion: Time to Act Is Now</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 23px;">The effects of climate change are already visible, 
               and if we don't act now, the consequences will be even more severe. </p>
